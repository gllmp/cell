## Description 

cell is a stack-based two-dimensional esoteric programming language made to create short audio visual poems. 

cell programs are written by placing letters on a 10x10 grid with each cell of the grid containing one letter/sound only. The grid is not displayed in the final output, it only defines display rules and operation space.
