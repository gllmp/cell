audio visual poetic language

cell is a stack-based two-dimensional esoteric programming language
made to create short audio visual poems.

cell programs are written by placing letters on a 10x10 grid with
each cell of the grid containing one letter/sound only. The grid is
not displayed in the final output, it only defines display rules and
operation space.
